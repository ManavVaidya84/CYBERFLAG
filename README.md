# CYBERFLAG
CYBERFLAG - Capture the flag, Capture the Fun
Cyber Flag is a cyber security based CTF model developed for our TechFest competition.
This project was created using PHP, HTML and JavaScript, and is designed to test real cyber security skills, logical reasoning, and problem-solving abilities.

In Cyber Flag, different flags are hidden throughout the system in multiple formats – the participant must detect, decode, reverse, and validate each one to score points.
Features & Concept
Skill Area	Challenge Type
Reverse Engineering	- Analysing scripts, logic flaws, encoded strings
Cryptographic Hash Knowledge - SHA-256, MD5, base64, hex encodings
Logical - Puzzle Solving	Pattern recognition, step-by-step deduction
Web Code Inspection -	HTML / JS element tracing, hidden DOM data
Obfuscation Breaking	Reading confusing or encrypted data structures

Each level hides the flag in a different way.
Flags are never shown directly. Instead, players must think like an attacker and uncover the real secret value by applying cyber security concepts.

Tech Stack Used

– Frontend: HTML + Tailwind CSS + JavaScript
– Backend: PHP
– Database: MySQL (for points, time tracking, user progress)

Scoring & Progression

Players earn points by solving each challenge.
Time taken for each flag is also recorded in the backend.
Next level only unlocks after the previous flag is successfully submitted.

Purpose / Learning Outcome

The aim of this model is:

to create a hands-on cyber security learning platform

to introduce real CTF problem formats

to encourage students to think like security analysts

to teach how to identify hidden data in modern web systems

This project demonstrates practical experience in:

secure coding

vulnerability thinking

reverse engineering logic

cryptographic awareness
